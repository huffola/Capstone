# Further development statement
### Dungeons & Developers

If we had one more year to work on this project, we would provide more options and better formatting of data for the user to be able to create more of what they might want to make. We would also spend more time refining and improving upon the overall user experience through the website and the discord bot. We would also have converted our use of sqlite to a stronger database system such as mongoDB as conflicts were created when the database is queried by both the web application and the Discord bot at the same time.
