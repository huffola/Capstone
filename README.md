# Capstone Design &amp; Implementation

Developers & Dragons - D&D 3.5 Helper Tool
==========================================

D&Dev is a web application that creates a helper-tool for D&D players using 3.5E. This tool will allow users to create accounts and manage characters. The database will house character information, as well as allow users to bookmark relevant game rules to their account. Alongside the web application there is a discord bot that will be able to reference data inside the database and perform simple functions like a dice roll.
